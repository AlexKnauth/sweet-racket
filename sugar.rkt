#lang racket/unit

;; Port of the original Guile code to Racket
;;
;; Implementation of a revision of SRFI 49, based on SRFI 49 at:
;; http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html
;; This provides "Indentation-sensitive syntax" for Scheme.
;; This SRFI descibes a new syntax for Scheme, called I-expressions,
;; with equal descriptive power as S-expressions. The syntax uses
;; indentation to group expressions, and has no special cases for
;;  semantic constructs of the language. It can be used both for
;;  program and data input.
;;
;; The following code implements I-expressions.
