Sweet expressions for Racket
============================

This is a port of [sweet expressions](http://www.dwheeler.com/readable/),
originally written by David Wheeler, from Scheme to the
[Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org) programming language. 

Racket is, in addition to being a normal programming
language, is a platform for language design. It provides
tools to easily develop your own languages. This port
enables existing Racket languages (such as Racket itself,
Typed Racket, and so on) to use the sweet expressions syntax
instead of s-expressions.

For more details on using this software, see the [PLaneT
page](http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=sweet.plt&owner=asumu)
for the latest release and for documentaiton.

The software is released under the MIT license under the
same terms as the original software.
