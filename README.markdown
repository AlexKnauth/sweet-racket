Sweet expressions for Racket
============================

This is a port of [sweet expressions](http://www.dwheeler.com/readable/),
originally written by David Wheeler, from Scheme to the
[Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org) programming language.

Racket is, in addition to a general purpose programming
language, a platform for language design. It provides
tools for developing your own languages and language
modifications, such as the software described here.

For more details on using this reader, see the [PLaneT
page](http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=sweet.plt&owner=asumu)
for the latest release and for documentaiton.

Note: the check syntax tool does work with this language, but
it may fail to activate when you first install it from PLaneT.
Changing the #lang line and then trying again should cause the
check syntax button to appear.

The software is released under the MIT license under the
same terms as the original implementation.
